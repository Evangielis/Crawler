# Project: Web Crawler  
For the purposes of this project, we define the Internet as the test data in this document, and a web crawler as software that requests pages from the Internet, parses the content to extract all the links in the page, and visits the links to crawl those pages, to an infinite depth.

# Structural Notes
The project is built in eclipse and uses the gradle wrapper to automate compilation and running of tests.  It makes use of Java's Fork/Join framework for concurrent task management as well and Google's org.simple.json for JSON parsing.

# How to Run It
There are two primary methods to run the project.
